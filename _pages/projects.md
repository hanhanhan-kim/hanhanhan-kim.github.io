## [Slim Deej](https://github.com/hanhanhan-kim/slim_deej)
A low-profile under-the-desk hardware set-up for running the open-source [Deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej) volume control software. Featuring my first ever PCB, designed in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).

## [Thoughts on Evolutionary Neuroscience](https://github.com/hanhanhan-kim/neuroevo_paper)
A paper I wrote for grad school on evolutionary neuroscience. In it, I talk about the role of stochastic evolutionary forces, and why thinking about them is important, especially with respect to nervous systems. 

## [40% Ortholinear Keyboard Cases]()

Cases I've designed for my pet obsession: 40% ortholinear keyboards. 
- **[Planckeneko for the Planck]()**: A gummy o-ring gasket-mounted case for the popular [Planck](https://olkb.com/collections/planck) keyboard. Based on the cleverly designed [Bakeneko 60](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60). 

- **[Qlaiver for the Plaid]()**: A silicone burger-mounted stacked acrylic case for the Plaid keyboard, reverse engineered from [Qlavier](https://twitter.com/qlavier)'s [image gallery](https://imgur.com/a/e2AHRcN). 

## [Bloid 40]((https://github.com/hanhanhan-kim/bloid40))
A handwired 40% keyboard that is Bluetooth and wireless based on [Victor Lucachi](https://victorlucachi.ro/)'s [Void 40](https://victorlucachi.ro/projects/void40/). My first ever original keyboard build. Powered by QMK. Although, for individuals who are interested in building wireless mechanical keyboards, I suggest that they use the newer ZMK codebase for writing firmware.

## [Zoomender](https://github.com/hanhanhan-kim/zoomender)

A big excessive button for ending Zoom calls. No software required, firmware only. Works on Linux, Windows, and Mac. Powered by [QMK](https://qmk.fm/). A symptom of the COVID-19 era.

## [Insect cooling stage](https://github.com/hanhanhan-kim/cold_stage)

A home- and budget-friendly cooling stage for anesthetizing insects. Useful for downstream behavioural and neurophysiological experiments. Handy for the COVID-19 era.
