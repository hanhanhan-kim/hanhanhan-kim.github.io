## 40% Ortholinear Keyboard Cases

Cases I've designed for my pet obsession: 40% ortholinear keyboards. 
- Planckeneko for the Planck: A gummy o-ring gasket-mounted keyboard case for the popular [Planck](https://olkb.com/collections/planck) keyboard. Based on the cleverly designed [Bakeneko 60](https://github.com/kkatano/bakeneko-60). 
- Qlaiver for the Plaid: A silicone burger-mounted stacked acrylic keyboard case for the Plaid, reverse engineered from [Qlavier](https://twitter.com/qlavier)'s [image gallery](https://imgur.com/a/e2AHRcN). 

## Insect cooling stage 

A home- and budget-friendly cooling stage for anesthetizing insects. Useful for downstream behavioural and neurophysiological experiments. Handy for the COVID-19 era.
