Hello, world! This post is my very first post on my website! I intend to showcase various projects I've designed and built, as well as my builds of other people's projects. I also intend to store things I frequently look up and reference when doing things, such as various boilerplate code. Currently, I have my own projects stored on GitHub as dedicated repos, and I have less substantial things stored as pages on my private Notion. I intend to consolidate some of those GitHub repos onto this website, as well as migrate my relevant Notion pages onto here.
