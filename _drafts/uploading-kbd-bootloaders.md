For whatever reason, uploading bootloaders to virgin ÂµC ICs really trips me up. This post is a running document of bootloader uploading protocols, for keyboards I've built that do not use a dev board (e.g. the Arduino Pro Micro, the Nice!Nano, etc.). I'll say it now ... 99% of the time, my struggles have to do with me cloning the wrong GitHub branch ....
