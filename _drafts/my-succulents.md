I recently went to a succulent show in LA, and got myself some cool-looking succulents! I find their patterns and geometries to be really mesmerizing. They're also pretty easy to take care of! Here's a photo of my succulent haul:

Clockwise from the top left: _Echeveria agavoides_ (Romeo), _Aloe juvenna_ (Tiger tooth aloe), _Aptenia variegata_, _Senecio haworthii_ (Wooly senecio), _Rebutia perplexa_, and _Haworthia pumila_ (South African variant)"%}

I printed some pots for my succulents in [Ziro Marble PLA](https://www.amazon.com/ZIRO-Printer-Filament-1-75mm-Marble/dp/B01IIAC2MW/ref=asc_df_B01IIAC2MW/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312157487430&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1766948271833383869&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031121&hvtargid=pla-375824825736&psc=1). I decided to print [this modern spiral pot](https://www.printables.com/model/225251-modern-spiral-planter), [this modern 'straight' pot](https://www.printables.com/model/201056-modern-planter), and [this modern round spiral pot](https://www.printables.com/model/202904-modern-planter-round).
