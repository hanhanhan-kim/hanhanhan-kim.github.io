In this post, I build the [Oddball](https://github.com/atulloh/oddball) (v2.1) keyboard! Like all my keyboards, it's a 40%, and it's also a wired split. The really cool thing about this keyboard though is that it features a trackball! In addition, the keyboard has reversible PCBs, features a tented case, and has separately angled thumb clusters.

## Case

I wanted to try something new with the case. I noticed that Oddball's [official docs](https://atulloh.github.io/oddball/v2/) feature a beautifully polished pool-green case, which really complements the 8-ball trackball. I wanted to emulate this build, and so I thought I would try my hand at post-processing my 3D-prints---namely, I wanted to try sanding, priming, and painting FDM 3D-printed PLA. I chose PLA as the filament because it's arguably the easiest material to print, and unlike PETG, lends itself well to (an albeit laborious) post-processing ritual. Another material that post processes well---actually, it post-processes much better than PLA---is ABS, because it's very susceptible to acetone smoothing, which is quick, easy, and yields great smoothing. ABS is a nightmare to print without an enclosure, however, and printing ABS yields toxic fumes. I chose white filament because white is the easiest colour to paint over. 

I used the YouTube tutorial below as a guide to PLA post-processing:

In the video, the host is sanding the parts by hand. I happen to own an orbital sander, however, and so I saved myself a lot of trouble by doing the sanding electronically. I start with 120 grit sandpaper.
