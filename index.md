## about me
My name is Han Kim. I am a PhD student in the neurobiology program at Caltech. I work in the lab of Joe Parker. 
My research interests concern the evolutionary and neural underpinnings of insect behaviours. 
I study rove beetles and their interactions with ants. 

Before grad school, I completed an undergraduate degree in both philosophy and genetics from the University of Toronto. 

Currently, I develop custom behaviour rigs and molecular genetic tools to study social interactions across insect species.
